# Road Map #
The schedule is tentative and for planning purposes.

## 0.7 dev ##

  * Access to dual prices, reduced costs, and similar values
  * Access to pricer settings and any other missing components
  * Improved build instructions
  * Improved examples library

## 0.8 dev ##
  * Rewrite in Cython
  * Exposure of SCIP components to implementation in Python:
    * branching rules
    * heuristics
    * presolving
    * separators
    * etc

## 0.9 beta ##
  * Beta testing period
  * Bug fixing

## 1.0 stable ##
  * Release candidate period
  * Final 1.0 release

## On Hold ##
  * .deb and .rpm files _(ZIB folks are planning to release .so files this year so we are waiting for that)_
